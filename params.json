As of right now the site has only one gallery up and running and the contact page still needs to be designed. The Gallery page is still being tweaked out as i am trying to put multiple javascript drawing on a page. I managed to do it with <iframe> but it can get a little tricky even with that.\r\n\r\n### Framework\r\nI used the bootstraps framework in order to organize the page. Although i am fairly comfortable with css i do still need more practice and having used the framework it took me a lot less time to position the elements than usual. Any time saving tricks are a welcome advantage in my arsenal of skills.\r\n\r\n",
